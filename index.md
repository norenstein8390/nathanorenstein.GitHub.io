## Welcome to Nathan Orenstein's Page

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/norenstein8390/nathanorenstein.GitHub.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Here is a data set that interests me: [COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19)

The data set lists confirmed cases, reported deaths, and reported recoveries from COVID-19. It's disaggregated by country. This data would be particularly useful to someone trying to determine which countries are being hit hardest by COVID-19. This knowledge could then lead to better practices to hopefully cut down the spread. It would also be helpful to see if the number of people getting sick and the number of people dying are going up or down as time goes on. This could show the effectiveness of current policies. 

Here is a book that interests me: [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

This textbook is a resource intended to help people enter the field of machine learning in general, and deep learning in particular. It's written by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. I'm interested in this book because I have a decent foundation in machine learning and I want to move forward by starting to learn how to do deep learning.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/norenstein8390/nathanorenstein.GitHub.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
